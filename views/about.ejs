                <p>Our team started working on this project because of a realisation we had while discussing about the medical industry of today and thinking how our breath is so easy to obtain but it was never really explored for the further development in diagnosis of different airborne diseases.</p>

                <p>Most of the tests that are done for medical purposes today are invasive, which are neither easy to do but also have many time and physical constraints. The development of a Non-Invasive technique in the detection of various diseases would make the process very convenient. </p>

                <p>While deep diving on this idea we noticed that we could use some particular principal VOCâ€™s in our breath along with previous data present on breath concentration of people to correlate them and classify them to check for different airborne diseases like TB with respectable accuracy and here is the our model representing our work.</p>
